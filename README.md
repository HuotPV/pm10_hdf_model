# pm10_hdf_model
The goal of this project is to build a model able to estimate PM10 concentrations from weather data using statistical modelling and ML methods.

# Status
For now, I have implemented two statistical modelling methods, namely:
- a linear regression model
- a random forest approach

# Datasets
- Weather data consists of ERA5 hourly data on single levels
- PM10 concentration measurements obtained from https://www.atmo-hdf.fr/
